No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows

No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give any more
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give any more

Well I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows

I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give any more
I can't live
(Live)
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give any more
(No, I can't live)
(No, I can't live)
No I
No no no no I
I can't live
(No, I can't live)
If living is without you...
(No, I can't live)
I can't live
I can't give any more
I can't live



Nighttime sharpens　heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs　and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defences
Slowly gently　night unfurls its splendour
Grasp it　sense it　tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night
Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes let your spirit start to soar
And you&#92;'ll live as you&#92;'ve never lived before
Softly　deftly　music shall caress you
Hear it　feel it　secretly possess you
Open up your mind　let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you can not fight
The darkness of the music of the night
Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then　can you belong to me
Floating　falling　sweet intoxication
Touch me　trust me　savor each sensation
Let the dream begin let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night
You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night...

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
